# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Implementation


## Description
This Jupyter Notebook involves implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch. It includes instructions and mark distributions for completing the assignment.

## Task Overview
- Build a Naive Bayes classifier on a mixed dataset containing both numerical and categorical features.
- Calculate conditional probabilities and find posterior probabilities for three provided samples in the `data_eval` pandas dataframe.
- Adhere to the rules prohibiting external library use (e.g., sklearn) in the implementation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Required Libraries
The following libraries are used in the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`
- `os`
- `statistics`
- `copy`
- `csv`
- `wget`

You can install missing libraries using `pip install <library_name>`.

## Instructions
1. Open the notebook.
2. Follow the provided instructions to complete the assignment.
3. Write your code in the marked sections (`# Write your code here`) only.
4. Do not modify the existing code outside of the marked sections.
5. Save and rename the files as instructed:
   - `.ipynb` file: `FirstName_LastName_Assignment1.ipynb`
   - `.py` file: `FirstName_LastName_Assignment1.py`

## Notes
- Submission must include both `.ipynb` and `.py` files.
- Review the dataset stored in the variable `mydata` and process it as per the instructions.
- Test your implementation on the evaluation samples in `data_eval`.
